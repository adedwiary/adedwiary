## üëã About Me

I am an analytical thinker and skilled data analyst focused on transforming complex data into actionable insights. As a Research Assistant at Bank Indonesia, I analyzed the impact of policies on loan provisioning for smaller banks using Stata and the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), providing strategic recommendations for better fund management. I also researched bank behavior in determining credit supply in Indonesia, analyzing factors such as interest rates and structural changes. Proficient in Python, R, MySQL, Stata, and Tableau, I ensure accurate data processing and visualization. With a proven track record and a collaborative approach, I am excited to drive impactful decisions through data-driven insights and contribute to your organization‚Äôs success.

## üìä Publications & Research:

- **Critical Minerals Industries in Indonesia: A Firm-Level Perspective**  
  - The study analyzes Indonesia's critical mineral industry ecosystem using primary data from mining companies and cost-benefit analysis with Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Net Present Value (NPV). It demonstrates the economic feasibility and profitability of nickel and copper downstream development, emphasizing faster returns through technological advancements. The findings highlight the need for collaboration between the private sector and government to balance economic, social, and environmental goals.
  
- **Bank Loan Loss Provisioning and Procyclicality Revisited: Evidence from Indonesia**  
  - This research analyzes the impact of discretionary and non-discretionary loan loss provisioning on bank loan growth in Indonesia, utilizing panel data from 117 banks over quarterly periods from 2011 to 2021 with a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The findings indicate that discretionary provisioning negatively affects small banks while increasing loan growth in large banks. The recommendation is to implement a dynamic provisioning system using the expected loan loss model to mitigate procyclicality in large banks.
